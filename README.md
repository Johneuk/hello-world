# hello-world
This is the best repository in the world. It is super-awesome because it's just there and doesn't do anything.

This is a text about myself. It's not code, it's just simple human-text. I'm learning to use git-hub because I'm starting to make and sell my first computer-game and also have in mind to create other cool stuff with computer-technology like robots, AI, surveillance-cameras, 3D printed objects, nifty software, 3D art and so on and so forth.

I could even use this git repository to write a book or a storyboard. We'll see. Have a nice day!
